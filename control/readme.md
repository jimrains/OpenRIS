This directory contains all the information necessary to set up and interface with the RIS prototype. 

RIS configurations are sent over a WiFi link hosted on the Raspberry Pi. A socket is established with MATLAB acting as the client, connecting to a server running on the Raspberry Pi. The server-side software is currently written in Python.
