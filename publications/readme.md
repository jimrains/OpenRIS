We have published work on the initial design in EuCAP 2023 which can be found:
[Rains et al., Fully-Addressable Varactor-Based Reflecting Metasurface with Dual-Linear Polarisation for Low Power Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces, EuCAP 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10133408)

Field trials in an outdoor urban macrocell were recently performed and the results will be published shortly. A draft of the paper can be found in this directory, titled RIS-Enhanced MIMO Channels in Urban Environments: Experimental Insights.
