# Hardware

This directory contains information regarding the RIS digital hardware. For information regarding the design of the metasurface, see [this paper](https://github.com/jimrains/USCRIS/blob/main/publications/1_bit_DP_EuCAP_2023_Conference-5.pdf).

The metasurface tiles are centered around high voltage shift registers. These each contain 32 push-pull digital outputs.
