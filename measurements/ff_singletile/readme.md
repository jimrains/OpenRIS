# Far-field measurements for a single RIS tile

## Usage

This archive contains CSV data extracted from 61 positions on a semi-circle (0 to 180 degrees with 3 degree steps) at a distance of 8.3 m from a single RIS tile for various transmitter positions. The directories are in the format **tx_\<Tx angle\>_\<Polarisation of Tx\>\<Polarisation of Rx\>**. For example, __tx_120_VV__ contains data for the 61 positions with the transmitter located at an angle of 120 degrees and both Tx and Rx antennas vertically-polarised. Within each Tx position directory are directories of the format **rx_\<Rx angle\>**. These each contain 11 CSV files, each file corresponding to a single RIS configuration.
